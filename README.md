## Introduction

The Weather App is a React-based application that provides current weather information for cities around the world. It fetches real-time data from an external weather API and displays details like temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more. This project helped me solidify key React concepts such as working with components, state, props, and API requests.
